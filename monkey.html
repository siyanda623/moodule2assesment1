                            <h3>MONKEY</h3>
    <p>is a common name that may refer to certain groups or species of simian mammals of infraorder Simiiformes. 
        The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates, such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys. 
        Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are
         mainly active during the day (diurnal).
         Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys of Catarrhini.</p>
     <p>Simians and tarsiers emerged within haplorrhines some 60 million years ago. New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the 
         simians some 35 million years ago. Old World monkeys and Hominoidea emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago.
          Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus [35-32 million years ago], eosimiidea and sometimes even the Catarrhini
         group are also considered monkeys by primatologists</p>
   <p>Apes emerged within "monkeys" as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. 
       here has been resistance to directly designate apes (and thus humans) as monkeys, 
       so "Old World monkey" may be taken to mean the Cercopithecoidea or the</p> 
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Most monkeys live in the tropical rainforests of Asia, Africa, and Central and South America, 
    or the savannas of Africa.</p>
